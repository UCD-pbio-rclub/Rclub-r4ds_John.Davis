## 5.6.7 Exercises

1. Brainstorm at least 5 different ways to assess the typical delay characteristics of a group of flights. Consider the following scenarios:
    * A flight is 15 minutes early 50% of the time, and 15 minutes late 50% of the time.
    * A flight is always 10 minutes late.
    * A flight is 30 minutes early 50% of the time, and 30 minutes late 50% of the time.
    * 99% of the time a flight is on time. 1% of the time itâ€™s 2 hours late.
  Which is more important: arrival delay or departure delay?
  
    Arrival delay is more important than departure delay. If a flight is delayed, it is still possible for the flight to make up time in the air. Arrival delay can cause a lot of problems though. Depending on how late a flight arrives, a person may end up missing their connecting flight o the next fight for that plane may be cancelled since the departure gate is no longer available. Would want some way to estimate the expected arrival delay based off flights travelling  the same path. And the usual arrival delay relative to the departure delay.
